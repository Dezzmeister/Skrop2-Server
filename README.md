# Skrop2-Server
Server for Skrop 2

The jar file takes 5 arguments (in this order): the name of the server, the infoserver TCP port, the first gameserver TCP/UDP port, the number of gameservers to start, and the number of milliseconds to wait before a client has timed out.
I'll finish this readme later
